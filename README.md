# StoryTogether
Stories are better when shared.

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Ever had a fantastic idea for a story, but no idea how to write it on your own? Using StoryTogether, you can begin your tale with a premise of your choosing and let other users submit their own plot ideas. Storytelling with others adds intrigue, unpredictability, and inspiration. Create and explore a new world together. Who knows where your adventure will take you?

### Design

The user starts out with a Login page. Once logged in, they see a home page with the stories they have personally created. They can choose to click the "start your story" button to create a story, or they could click "browse" to browse story ideas from other users. If the title of a story is clicked on, the user is taken to the story page, where the title, premise, and users' thoughts and ideas are visible.
