## Git and GitHub

It's easier to create a repository in Github first and then clone it locally.

git add -> git commit -> git push

git fetch: get latest info about changes in Github without changing local repo

git status: see differences between clones

GithHub fork: provides the ability to create a copy of a GitHub repository on GitHub

To change something in someone else's repo: fork repo, then pull request with changes

## Vim

To use VI, open your console and change directory to one that holds some code you want to work on. For example, if you wanted to edit index.html you would type: vi index.html

Vim commands:
keystroke	meaning
:h	help
i	enter insert mode. This will allow you to type and delete text. Use ESC to exit insert mode. No other commands will work while in insert mode.
u	undo
CTRL-r	redo
gg	go to beginning of file
G	go to end of file
/	search for text that you type after /
n	next search match
N	previous search match
v	visually select text
y	yank or copy selected text to clipboard
p	paste clipboard
CTRL-wv	Split window vertically
CTRL-ww	Toggle windows
CTRL-wq	Close current window
:e	Open a file. Type ahead available. If you open a directory you can navigate it in the window
:w	write file (save)
:q	quit. Use :q! to exit without saving

## AWS

My IP address is: 52.70.18.49
SSH command: 
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
Ex: ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123
Everything worked great.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
